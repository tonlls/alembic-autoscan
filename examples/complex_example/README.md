# Complex Example Project

This example demonstrates how `alembic-autoscan` handles more complex model structures, including:
- Mixins for tablenames
- Cross-module relationships
- Multiple model files

## Features

- **Automatic Model Discovery**: No need to import models in `env.py`.
- **Mixin Support**: Using `ArticleTablename` mixin to define `__tablename__`.
- **Relational Mapping**: Demonstration of `User` -> `Post` and `User` -> `Article` relationships.

## How to run

1. Navigate to this directory:
   ```bash
   cd examples/complex_example
   ```

2. Initialize migrations (already configured in `alembic.ini` and `alembic/env.py`):
   ```bash
   uv run alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Initial migration"
   ```

3. Run migrations:
   ```bash
   uv run alembic upgrade head
   ```

Observe that even though `env.py` only imports `Base`, all models are discovered and included in the autogenerated migration.
